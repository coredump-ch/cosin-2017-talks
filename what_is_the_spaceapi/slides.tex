\section{What is the SpaceAPI?}

\begin{frame}{What is the SpaceAPI?}
	Imagine that you're travelling in a foreign country. Bored from all the
	tourist attraction, you start wondering -- are there any likeminded people
	around?

	So you start looking for a hackerspace, makerspace or fablab. How can you find
	out where the next such space is located?

\begin{frame}{What is the SpaceAPI?}
	You found a hackerspace not too far away. There are a few things that you
	would typically want to know about that space:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item	What's the website URL of the space?
		\pause
		\item Where is the space located?
		\pause
		\item How can you contact the people from the space?
		\pause
		\item Is the space currently open?
		\pause
		\item How many people are there right now?
		\pause
		\item What projects do the people in the space work on?
		\pause
		\item How much Club Mate is still left?
	\end{itemize}

	\pause

	That's the questions the SpaceAPI tries to answer.

\begin{frame}[c]{The SpaceAPI}
	The SpaceAPI is a specification for a JSON object that contains all this
	information in machine readable code.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Minimal Example}
	\begin{minted}[samepage=true,fontsize=\footnotesize]{json}
{
    "api": "0.13",
    "space": "coredump",
    "url": "https://www.coredump.ch/",
    "contact": {
        "email": "vorstand@lists.coredump.ch",
        "irc": "irc://freenode.net/#coredump",
        "twitter": "@coredump_ch"
    },
    "issue_report_channels": ["email", "twitter"],
    "location": {
        "address": "ZÃ¼rcherstrasse 6, 8640 Rapperswil, Switzerland",
        "lat": 47.22939, "lon": 8.82041
    },
    "logo": "https://www.coredump.ch/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/logo.png",
    "state": { "open": true, "message": "7 people present" }
}
	\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Versioning}
Every SpaceAPI document must contain the specification version:

	\begin{minted}[samepage=true,fontsize=\footnotesize]{javascript}
{
    "api": "0.13",
    // ...
}
	\end{minted}

Current version is 0.13, we're already working on the next revision. More on
that later.
